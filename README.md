Responsive Slider package 
=========================

## About

This is a simple slider plugin written in pure Javascript that is designed to be lightweight, fast and responsive.

## Installation

This is a published meteor package and can be installed using the commands: 

```sh
$ cd /my-meteor-project
$ mrt add matfin:slider
$ meteor
```

Given that this has been written in pure JS, there are no additional package requirements.

## Why this slider ?

I have written this slider to be as small and fast as possible, and tried to keep it doing very simple things that work well, instead of creating something large, complicated and bulky.

The aim is to minimise the number of recalculations required on interaction, use the hardware acceleration features of modern browsers, and deliver a smooth user experience even on low powered devices.

## Features

- Fully responsive, meaning it will work on mobile and tablet devices just as well as desktop devices.
- Touch support, meaning the slider responds to touch events if supported, or normal mouse events.
- Responds well to window resize events and recalibrates itself.
- Makes use of requestAnimationFrame, for smoother transitions.
- Fires custom events, so you can write your own code to handle these.

## Support 

- This plugin has been tested to work on the latest two versions of most modern browsers, including the following
	- Internet Explorer >= 10
	- Safari
	- Firefox 
	- Chrome
	- Opera

## Known issues

- Swipe to scroll does not work for the default Android browser, as the touchmove event behaves in an unusual way. There is no immediate plan to address this issue, given the fact that Chrome is starting to replace this browser.
